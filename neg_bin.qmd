```{r}
#| label: sample from negative binomial
samples = rnbinom(100, size = 1/2, mu = 10)
hist(samples)
hist(log(samples+1))
```

```{r}
#| include: false
#| label: compute mean and var
mu = mean(samples)
vari = var(samples)
#print(paste("The value of the mean is ", mu))

```

The value of the mean is `r mu` and of the variance is `r vari` .

## Steps

I used the function rnbinom with size = dispersion = 2 and mean as indicated (10). The empirical mean and variance were {{< var mu >}} and {{< var vari >}} respectively.
